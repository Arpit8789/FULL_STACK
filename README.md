 📚 Full Stack Projects & Assignments

This repository contains full-stack development assignments and practice projects created as part of our college coursework. While I've previously worked on several full-stack applications independently, this repo is specifically organized to meet the requirements set by our instructor.

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Demonstrate understanding of full-stack concepts taught in class
- Practice structured development workflows
- Submit assignments in a clean and organized format
- Collaborate and share learning with peers
